## Project Overview
The Edmonton Food Drive Project aims to develop a machine learning solution to optimize the management of food donation activities in Edmonton, AB. The project focuses on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of drop-off and pick-up processes, streamlining route planning, and improving resource allocation.

## Problem Statement
The current food donation management system in Edmonton faces challenges in coordinating drop-off locations, pick-up processes, and route planning. There is a need to automate and optimize these processes to ensure timely collection of donations and minimize logistical complexities.

## Objectives
- **Optimize Drop-off Locations**: Develop a machine learning model to identify the best drop-off locations based on geographic distribution and donation density.
- **Automate Pick-up Route Planning**: Implement a system for assigning and optimizing pick-up routes based on geographic structure and donation counts.
- **Enhance Stakeholder Coordination**: Streamline communication and coordination between Regional Coordinators, Stake Food Drive Representatives, and Ward Food Drive Representatives.
- **Improve Data Collection and Analysis**: Enhance data collection mechanisms to gain insights into donation patterns, resource utilization, and areas of improvement.

## Solution Approach
1. **Data Analysis and Machine Learning**: 
   - Utilize historical donation data and geographic information to identify optimal drop-off locations using clustering algorithms.
   
2. **Route Planning Algorithm**: 
   - Develop an efficient routing algorithm considering donation density, distance, and time constraints using VRP solutions.

3. **Data Collection Mechanism**: 
   - Integrate real-time data collection to monitor donation counts, route progress, and resource utilization.

## Data Sources
- 2023 and 2024 Edmonton Food Drive Dataset from Google and Microsoft Survey Forms
