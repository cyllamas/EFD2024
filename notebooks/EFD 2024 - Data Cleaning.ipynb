    "The Edmonton Food Drive is a collaborative initiative designed to tackle food insecurity in Edmonton. This drive ​mobilizes volunteers and resources to collect and distribute food to those in need. By leveraging machine learning, ​the project aims to enhance operational efficiency and maximize the impact of each donation. The integration of ​real-time data and optimized routing will contribute to a more streamlined and effective food distribution process.\n"

Next, we create a new column called 'Ward' by combining values from multiple stake columns, then delete those original stake columns since they are no longer needed. We update the 'Drop Off Locations' column using values from 'Other Drop Off Locations' when available, then remove the 'Other Drop Off Locations' column. A new column named 'Year' is added with the value 2024 to prepare for merging with the 2023 dataset. We rename some columns for clarity and remove any duplicate rows. Null values in the \"Did you complete more than 1 route?\" column are replaced with 1, assuming volunteers took only one route. Several fields, including 'Form Method,' 'Drop Off Location,' 'Stake,' 'Time Spent,' and 'Ward,' are converted to categorical data types. Finally, we map the 'Time Spent' values to numerical integers to ensure consistency. These steps clean and organize the dataset for further analysis."
